# Space_Exploration_Dashboard_Service_Layers

## Description of Application
The Space Exploration Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with the latest updates on space missions, upcoming space-related events, and current space weather conditions. It's tailored for space enthusiasts and professionals alike to stay informed and engaged with the progress of space exploration.

## Overview of this Repo
The Service Layers for the Space Exploration Dashboard acts as the middleware between the user interface and the database. It handles all backend logic, data retrieval, manipulation, and API endpoint exposure.

## Purpose of this Repo
The service layers ensure that data is correctly processed and served to the UI. They enable the core functionalities of the dashboard by providing RESTful APIs that the front end consumes.

## Role in the Overall Application 

The service layers play a critical role in the application's architecture, providing a separation of concerns that enhances maintainability and scalability. They act as an abstraction layer that allows the UI to be developed and function independently of the data storage mechanisms.
